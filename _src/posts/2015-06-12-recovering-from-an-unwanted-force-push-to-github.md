Oops! Did you accidentally force push the wrong commit to a branch on github? Even worse, do none of your coworkers have the old (correct) commit on their machine because that commit was created by github when merging a pull requeest? Well, you are outta luck as far as the github UI goes; there's no way that I can find to force reset a branch to a specific commit. Calm down, there is hope. Here is what you have to do:

Find the hash of commit that you force pushed over. Git should have told you this at the time you did the force push:

```bash
% git push --force origin master
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (2/2), 284 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 2 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/antialias/antialias.github.io.git
 + 3c15973...41c4d05 master -> master (forced update)
```

In this case, the commit hash you want is `3c15973` (the one on the left on the last line). Keep that handy.

Now, using Chrome, keep your network inspector running while you create a dummy branch on github:

![make dummy branch](/images/make-dummy-branch.png)

Find the specific network request that created the new branch. It should be a POST:

![copy branch curl](/images/copy-curl-branch.png)

You should have a string in your clipboard that looks like this:

```bash
curl 'https://github.com/antialias/antialias.github.io/branches' -H 'Cookie: {a mess of cookies}' -H 'Origin: https://github.com' -H {a mess of headers} --data 'utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity\_token=__my-secret-auth-token__%3D%3D&name=dummy&branch=master&path=' --compressed
```

See where we are going with this? Now that you have this request copied, delete that new dummy branch from github because we are going to make it again, but a little differently.

Find the name of the parent branch in the the curl command that you copied. In this case it was `master`. Replace the parent branch name with the hash that you found from the output of your accidental force push, `3c15973`. Now paste this modified command into your terminal.

If all goes well, your dummy branch will be re-created and will be pointing to the commit that you overwrote with your accidental force push. `git fetch` and the old commit that you want will be pulled down to you local repository. Now force reset your branch to the old commit and force-push it back up to github:

```bash
git checkout master
git reset --hard `3c15973`
git push --force origin master
```

And now you are back in business!
